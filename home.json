The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when Jimmy Page brought in John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant to tour as The New Yardbirds. In 1969, Led Zeppelin released its self-titled debut which was produced by Page, as were all the subsequent albums. It marked the beginning of a 12-year reign, during which the group was widely considered to be the biggest and most innovative rock band in the world.",

No - we will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let me go\nWill not let you go - let me go (never)\nNever let you go - let me go\nNever let me go - ooo\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no -\nOh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\nfor me\nfor me\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die\nOh baby - can't do this to me baby\nJust gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here\n\nOoh yeah, ooh yeah\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters - nothing really matters to me\n\nAnyway the wind blows...\n\n#QueenTheGreatest #BohemianRhapsody #Remastered #Queen\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.
