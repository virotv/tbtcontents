The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when Jimmy Page brought in John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant to tour as The New Yardbirds.

No - we will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let me go\nWill not let you go - let me go (never)\nNever let you go - let me go\nNever let me go - ooo\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no -\nOh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\nfor me\nfor me\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die\nOh baby - can't do this to me baby\nJust gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here\n\nOoh yeah, ooh yeah\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters - nothing really matters to me\n\nAnyway the wind blows...\n\n#QueenTheGreatest #BohemianRhapsody #Remastered #Queen\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel Here https://Queen.lnk.to/Subscribe\nWatch more: https://Queen.lnk.to/OfficialMusicVideos\n\nAbout Queen:\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.
